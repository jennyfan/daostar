# Simple Summary

A set of applicable controls for improving DAO security

# Motivation

DAO security is a multi-faceted concept. Because of their decentralized nature, security measures vary across DAOs. DAOIP-8 aims to establish a minimum viable security standard among DAOs. Our intention is to ensure that at least the controls defined in this guide are standard practice in all organizations, irrespective of their scale. In writing this, we have considered data transparency, decentralized ownership, proposal safety, vendor management, defense against governance attacks, physical security, code upgrades, and other angles. While the absence of some of these (for example, a physical security policy for delegates) can lead to a critical security incident, others (for example, data transparency) may not have an immediate side effect. Even so, it may lead to second-order effects (e.g., low data transparency → loss of quality contributors → governance takeover). Hence, all DAOs are recommended to make their best effort to follow the controls outlined below.

Please note that this guide is a work in progress. It should not be taken as the gold standard when it comes to DAO security, but rather as the minimum. Several sections (for example, _vendor management policy_, or _incident response_) need to be polished to fit the design of your DAO. Security practices in Web2 organizations are generally more mature than in Web3 organizations like DAOs. Therefore, many of the templates and inspiration documents referenced have Web2 origins. We urge DAOs to modify them considering their unique properties.

# Technical Governance

In addition to the recommended best practices described above, this document is also intended to provide a set of recommended controls and best practices for DAOs to establish the basic foundations of a _Technical Governance_ framework. This guide is in no way exhaustive and does not explicitly focus on prescriptive implementation details, but rather defines and describes core precepts which can be further expounded upon by contributors and stakeholders.

The intention is to tackle the dilemma of _Technical Governance_ as it relates to DAOs and their usage of services and technologies which are either directly or indirectly related to the DAO's operations, for example, GitHub or GitLab repositories, cloud services, and other third-party providers. These external dependencies introduce novel complexities without clear boundaries relating to technical asset ownership and management. In addition to more traditional Web2 assets, DAOs also need to take on-chain assets into account when considering their security posture by defining and implementing specific controls around code security, vulnerability management, incident response, auditing, etc.

This guide encourages DAOs to ask the question: "If we can successfully govern a treasury, why can we not also govern our own technical footprint, operations, and security posture?" This resource aims to provide a starting point for DAOs to begin to answer this question.

While complete decentralization is the ultimate goal, it is important to recognize that the DAO ecosystem is still in its infancy and explicitly relies upon a myriad of centralized infrastructures and services in order to operate. These aforementioned dependencies are not typically taken into consideration when discussing DAO governance and thus present unique challenges to DAOs in terms of security and operational risks.

# Categories of Controls

Controls below are categorized into: 
1. `[MANDATORY]`: includes measures that are critical to ensuring DAO security.
2. `[RECOMMENDED]`: includes measures that may not have an immediate effect, but have second-order security effects.

We recommend following both categories of controls to ensure maximum security in your DAO.

The first section is applicable for _all DAOs_, irrespective of their type.

The second section is for _protocol DAOs_, i.e., DAOs that control an on-chain protocol. All DAOs, whether or not they are a _protocol DAO_, are advised to consider the controls detailed in the first section.

Community contributions are essential for the ongoing evolution of this guide. Kindly refer to the contribution guide below for instructions.

# Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## DAO Controls

| Control | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Data transparency | 1. `[MANDATORY]` The DAO should publish an up to date __resource__, outlining the steps, scope and stakeholders involved in governance.<br><br> Data transparency is critical to an organization’s security. The resource should clearly define the person(s) responsible for its upkeep, along with a channel to reach out to them if information is incorrect or outdated. The resource should include but not limit to the following:<br><br><ul><li>Mandatroy steps in the governance process (temp checks, RFCs, timelines, vote thresholds), type of election (ranked choice, single choice, first past the post, etc).</li><li>Rules of elections, and elected position descriptions and contact information.</li></ul> Along with key details on governance design, and operational rules, the governance document __SHOULD__ include information on all *__privileged roles__* (details on who can do what). Privileged roles should include information pertaining to the powers delegated to said role and identify the addresses associated with each role. For example, can anyone create a new proposal, can proposals be vetoed, are proposal executions autonomous, etc?<br><br>2. `[RECOMMENDED]` The DAO should maintain a repository of all DAO-related artifacts.<br><br> DAO-related artifacts include (but are not limited to) grant programs; list of all smart contracts; list of functional committees, councils and multisigs; trusted service providers; and financial reporting. We recommend using the EIP-4824 standard to facilitate this, as it allows decentralized control of data by the DAO.|
| Ownership of assets | `[MANDATORY]` The DAO should make public a list of all assets it owns and controls. The list could include crypto tokens, ENS names and other naming services, dApps, frontends, physical assets, etc. |
| Self defense, incident response, auditing, and vulnerability management |It is imperative to have a course of action or otherwise defensive capability for responding to security incidents and events which pose a risk to the core operations of a DAO or it's technical assets. This includes things such as CVE remediation, DNS hijacking/infrastructure compromise, KPI definitions for security event monitoring and response. The intention here is to prompt the creation of a plan - no critical details of the incident response plan need to be public. A template for inspiration is available [here](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-08/Federal_Government_Cybersecurity_Incident_and_Vulnerability_Response_Playbooks_508C.pdf) (not Web3/DAO specific). While there are many overlapping security considerations with Web2 practices, it is important to take DAO specific concerns into account. Additionally, it is necessary to also consider proactive controls for things such as MFA requirements, IAM best practices and regular reviews/audits of permissions for developers or technical contributors. <br><br> 1. `[MANDATORY]` The DAO must publish a self-defense and emergency management plan.<br><br> 2. `[RECOMMENDED]` The DAO should publish a vulnerability management plan. Sample [template](https://frsecure.com/vulnerability-management-policy-template/) (not Web3/DAO specific).  |
| Vendor/service provider management Policy | 1. `[MANDATORY]` The DAO should publish a list of vendors/service providers it relies upon.<br><br> 2. `[RECOMMENDED]` The DAO should publish a vendor management policy. [Inspiration here](https://frameworks.securityalliance.org/external-security-reviews/vendor-selection.html).<br><br>*Vendors include all 3rd party service providers that provide a good or service to the DAO, including software services that are not paid by the DAO, but used for operations, governance or other avenues*.|
| Proposal safety | `[RECOMMENDED]` It is recommended to: <br><br><ul><li> Use a timelock before upgrading protocols that hold assets.</li><li>Simulate proposals before executing them.</li><li>Perform automated checks on proposals for common attacks.</li><li>Quorum threshold definitions for core governance changes.</li><li>Auditing and review of governance mutating transactions by qualified contributors to ensure expected outcomes match voter preferences.</li></ul> |
| Physical security training | `[MANDATORY]` The DAO should publish a physical security recommendation and provide training to combat wrench attacks.<br><br> The DAO is recommended to focus on educational content that describes measures to be taken by key delegates, multisig signers, members of the foundation, and other important stakeholders to ensure security while traveling to conferences and other events. Inspiration taken from [here](https://github.com/OffcierCia/Crypto-OpSec-SelfGuard-RoadMap). Key recommendations could include the following:<br><br><ul><li>Hardware wallet management.</li><li>Laptop security.</li><li>Usage of public WiFi.</li><li>Social engineering defense.</li><li>AirBnB/hotel security.</li></ul> |
| Community management | `[MANDATORY]` The DAO should follow secure community management processes, to secure community accounts on Twitter, Discord, Telegram, and other applications. This section is intended to be a companion to the incident response and emergency management recommendations. For example, a defined process for responding to and remediating a compromised social media account. Template [here](https://frameworks.securityalliance.org/community-management/index.html). |
| Compliance | `[MANDATORY]` The DAO must keep a record of its compliance efforts, including policies, procedures, and audit results. It should make its best efforts to comply with the regulatory frameworks applicable to its areas of incorporation.<br><br> Note that regardless of DAO jurisdiction or its regulatory standing, assets such as websites, frontends, forums, etc. can be subject to various data privacy laws. It is recommended to make a concerted effort to adhere to regulatory obligations to prevent future burdens or headaches such as “DSARs” and “Right to be forgotten” requests.|

## Protocol Controls

The following set of controls are authored for protocol DAOs, i.e DAOs that control an on-chain protocol. All DAOs, irrespective of whether they are a protocol DAO, are advised to follow the controls detailed in the previous section.

| Control | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Data transparency | 1. `[MANDATORY]` Code that the DAO governs should be available somewhere publicly. <br><br>2. `[RECOMMENDED]` There should be publicly accessible documentation on the protocol components, along with flow diagrams, design choices, dependencies and a record of critical privileged roles. All DAO related smart contracts including protocol, token, governance and treasury related smart contracts, should be documented, as well as verified on block explorers (if the provision exists).|
| Code security | 1. `[MANDATORY]` Protocol code __MUST__ be audited, and a comprehensive report detailing vulnerabilities and suggested improvements should be publicly available for the latest protocol version.|
| Bug bounty program | 1. `[RECOMMENDED]` The DAO is recommended to operate a bug bounty program.<br><br>2. `[RECOMMENDED]` The DAO is recommended to execute a white hat [Safe Harbor agreement](https://github.com/security-alliance/safe-harbor).|
| Key management | `[MANDATORY]` Use isolated and purpose specific hardware wallets for multisig key holders and delegates. SAFEs or other account abstraction implementations should also be deployed in all operational areas. |
| Operational security policy for key entities |`[RECOMMENDED]` The DAO should require entities, including its foundation, founding company, or service providers with a long-term service agreement, to publish and adhere to an operational security policy.<br><br>Inspiration for the policy is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Aggn3oqT3lpTFyVmlncBTOowdpTsrGtPqCmdKcQnEdA/edit?usp=sharing). As above, the intention is to prompt operational security for all stakeholders and not to publish critical information publicly. |
| Subdomains for contracts and dApps | `[RECOMMENDED]` It is recommended to provide all contracts with ENS names. dApps should enforce ENS subdomain versioning schemas (v1, v2, etc) as mentioned [here](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/undefined-0ejxp).<br><br> This is a best practice for future management of organizational units when delegating responsibilities to working groups or other sub-organizations within the DAO. Additionally this provision helps ensure that versioning remains immutable and easy to understand.|
